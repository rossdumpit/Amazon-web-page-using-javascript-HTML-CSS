Project Title
Amazon Web Page Clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🛒💻

Introduction / Description
This project was developed as part of a tutorial series by SuperSimpleDev. The initial HTML and CSS structure was provided, but I added the features through the tutorial and experimented with functionality. The primary objective was to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals — including syntax, data handling, and interaction between different components of a web page 📜✨.

Through this project, I practiced applying the MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern 🔄, implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles 🧩, and performed unit testing with Jasmine ✅. I also gained exposure to backend concepts such as asynchronous operations and fetch for data handling ⏳🗄️.
